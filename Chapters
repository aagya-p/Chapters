<h1> Chapter 1: Computer System </h2>
<b> Introduction </b>
<p> Computer is an electronic device device derived from the Latin word "computere" which means to calculate. It accepts raw facts and figures as an input which are isolated and uninterpreted through input device, process it according to the requirement of the user or command supplied by the user, store it before and after processing of require and produce a meaningful information as an output through an output device. Generally, computer works on IPO (Input-Process-Output) cycle. It follows GIGO (Garbage In Garbage Out) algorithm which means the output is always based on the input supplied by the user. The basic operation of computer is illustrated by following block diagram.

<h3>Generations of Computers</h3>
    <p>History of computers dates back to the mechanical era where computers were not used for general purposes. It took a long period of time to reach this phase. The development of computers passed through different eras, from mechanical to electromechanical to digital computers. The development in different electronic components, precise engineering, and hi-tech technology has drastically changed the operation of computers. Earlier, computers were only used for specific purposes such as counting and performing basic mathematical operations. Later on, due to the necessity and requirements of users, different general-purpose computers were developed. Therefore, the classification of computers based on their major electronic components, architecture, and modes of operation is known as the generations of computers. Below are the five different generations of computers along with their distinct features:</p>

            <td>
                The CPU is the brain of any computer system. Like in the human body, all major decisions are made by the brain. Similarly, in a computer, all major calculations and comparisons are made inside the CPU. The CPU is also responsible for activating and controlling the operation of other units of a computer system. A microprocessor is a single chip that performs the function of the CPU in microcomputers.
            </td>
            <td>
                The job of an output unit is the reverse of an input unit. It supplies information and the results of computation to the outside world. Thus, it links the computer with the external environment. It consists of devices that translate information processed by the computer into a form that humans can understand.

<h2>Computer Memory and Classification</h2>

    <div>
        <h2>1) Primary Memory/Main Memory</h2>
        <p>
            Primary Memory is also known as the main memory of a computer. This is the place where our data and instructions are stored before processing, and the results are stored before displaying the output. Memory which stores data and information currently being used by the computer is known as primary memory.
        </p>

        <h3>Features of Primary Memory:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>It is not used to store data permanently.</li>
            <li>It is usually volatile except ROM.</li>
            <li>It is usually expensive and faster than secondary storage.</li>
            <li>It is normally used for smaller storage.</li>
            <li>It is not used to transfer data from one computer to another computer.</li>
            <li>It is made up of semiconducting material.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>There are two types of Primary Memory:</h3>
        <table>
<tr>
<td>
        <h4>1.1) RAM (Random Access Memory)</h4>
        <p>RAM stores data and instructions temporarily. It is volatile, meaning data is erased when the power is cut off. RAM is a read-write memory.</p>

        <h5>Types of RAM:</h5>
        <ul>
            <li><b>SRAM (Static Random Access Memory)</b>: Made up of transistors. It doesn't need periodic refreshing like DRAM. It is faster but consumes more power.</li>
            <li><b>DRAM (Dynamic Random Access Memory)</b>: Made up of capacitors. It needs to be refreshed periodically. It is slower and consumes less power than SRAM.</li>
        </ul>
</td>
<td>
        <h4>1.2) ROM (Read Only Memory)</h4>
        <p>ROM stores data permanently and is non-volatile. Data remains intact even when the power is off. It is used for storing firmware and the boot-up program.</p>

        <h5>Types of ROM:</h5>
        <ul>
            <li><b>PROM (Programmable ROM)</b>: Can be programmed once by using a special machine.</li>
            <li><b>EPROM (Erasable Programmable ROM)</b>: Can be reprogrammed by erasing data using ultraviolet light.</li>
            <li><b>EEPROM (Electrically Erasable Programmable ROM)</b>: Can be erased and reprogrammed multiple times using electrical pulses.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
    <div>
        <h2>2) Secondary Memory/Auxiliary Memory</h2>
        <p>Secondary memory stores data permanently for future reference. It is non-volatile and remains intact without power. It has a huge storage capacity, and it is also known as auxiliary memory.</p>

        <h3>Types of Secondary Memory:</h3>

    <tr>
        <td>
            <h4>2.1) Magnetic Storage</h4>
            <p>Data is stored in the form of magnetic spots. Magnetic materials are used to store data on devices like hard disks and floppy disks.</p>
            <h5>Examples of Magnetic Storage:</h5>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Hard Disk</b>: A sealed disk consisting of multiple magnetic platters. It is used for storing large volumes of data.</li>
                <li><b>Floppy Disk</b>: A round, flat disk used for storing data, much smaller in capacity compared to hard disks.</li>
            </ul>
        </td>
        <td>
            <h4>2.2) Optical Storage</h4>
            <p>Optical storage uses laser beams to read and write data. It is used for storing large amounts of data on optical disks such as CDs and DVDs.</p>
            <h5>Examples of Optical Storage:</h5>
            <ul>
                <li><b>CD-ROM</b>: Can store up to 700 MB of data. It is used for storing software, videos, and audio.</li>
                <li><b>DVD</b>: Can store more data than CD-ROM and is used for storing even larger files.</li>
            </ul>
        </td>
        <td>
            <h4>2.3) Flash Memory</h4>
            <p>Flash memory is a non-volatile, erasable, and programmable solid-state memory made of semiconductor chips. It is commonly used in devices like memory cards, USB drives, etc.</p>

<h1> Chapter 2:  Number System, Conversion and Boolean Logic </h1>
<h2>Boolean Operator and Operands</h2>

    <p>
        Operators are the symbols that define the specific operation. These are three basic operators used in Boolean Algebra, i.e. AND, OR, NOT. Every other operation can be expressed in terms of these basic operations. For example, the NOR operator is the combination of NOT and OR operators. The three basic operators are:
    </p>
<table>
<tr>
<td>
    <h2>a. AND Operators</h2>
    AND operator is represented by “.” So, A AND B is represented by (A.B). The result of the AND operation is exactly the same as simple arithmetic multiplication. That means the result will be high (1) only when both the inputs are high. Note: A AND B can also be represented by AˆB or AnB.

<h1>Chapter 3: Software </h1>
    
    <p>As we know, stand-alone hardware cannot do anything. For the smooth operation of our Computer System, there should be proper coordination between hardware and software. Software helps to mobilize the hardware and other resources. In order to mobilize hardware, we have to write several sets of instructions which instruct the computer what to do and what not to do. These sets of instructions are collectively known as a program, and the term software is the collection of related programs and associated documents.</p>

    <p>In order to produce useful output, hardware and software must work together. Nothing useful can be done with hardware only, and software cannot be utilized without hardware.</p>

    <h2>The different types of software are:</h2>
    <h3>1) System Software</h3>
    <p>System software is a set of one or more programs designed to control the operation of our computer system. This type of software doesn't fulfill the specific requirements of the user. They are general programs written to assist humans in the use of the computer system. System software supports the running of other software, communicates with peripheral devices, supports the development of other types of software, and monitors the use of various hardware resources. Thus, the system software makes the operation of the computer system more effective and efficient.</p>

    <h4>1.1) System Management</h4>
    <p>System management is responsible for proper management and functioning of the computer system. All types of management between computer hardware and software are performed by system management software. There are 3 types of system management software:</p>
    <table>
<tr>
<td>
    <h5>1.1.1) Operating System</h5>
    <p>The operating system is a collection of programs that control the overall operation of the computer system. It is the first program that is loaded into memory when the computer is turned on. It provides a platform for other application programs to run and execute. It provides users with an interface so that they can easily communicate with the computer. For example, Linux, Windows, Mac, etc.</p>
</td>
<td>
    <h5>1.1.2) Utility Software</h5>
    <p>Utility software is supporting software that performs specific tasks related to the maintenance of the computer system. Some utility software is included in the operating system, while others are available separately in the market. They are also called service programs. Examples include Norton Utility, PC Tools, WinZip, etc.</p>
</td>
<td>
    <h5>1.1.3) Device Driver</h5>
    <p>A device driver is a software responsible for the smooth functioning of hardware devices connected to the computer. When a new device is added, a new software called a device driver is installed. The driver coordinates with the operating system to ensure that the newly installed hardware functions properly.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
    <h4>1.2) System Development</h4>
    <p>System development refers to a set of programs used to develop computer programs. This type of software is not used by a normal user but by programmers for the development of new programs. There are two types of system development software:</p>
    <table>
<tr>
<td>
    <h5>1.2.1) Programming Language</h5>
    <p>The language with which instructions are given to the computer is known as the programming language. Programming languages consist of keywords, variables, operators, loops, and other symbols. They help facilitate communication between the computer and the user. There are two types of programming languages: low-level language and high-level language.</p>
</td>
<td>
    <h5>1.2.2) Language Translator</h5>
    <p>A language translator is a special software that translates programs written in one language into another language. This translation is necessary for both low-level and high-level languages. The types of language translators include compilers, interpreters, and assemblers.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
    <h3>2) Application Software</h3>
    <p>Application software is a set of one or more programs designed to perform a specific task. These programs are developed to fulfill user demands and direct the computer to solve user-oriented problems, such as preparing bills, calculating equations, and creating mark sheets. Examples include MS-Excel, Photoshop, billing software, etc.</p>
<table>
<Tr>
<td>
    <h4>2.1) Packaged Software</h4>
    <p>Packaged software is a generalized set of programs designed and developed for general purposes. These software are generally large-sized, error-free, advanced, and standard, offering much functionality for special work. While these software might not perfectly match the requirements of many organizations, they are developed by reputed software companies and are considered trustworthy. Examples include MS-Office, Adobe, Macromedia, etc.</p>
</td>
<td>
    <h4>2.2) Customized / Tailored Software</h4>
    <p>Customized software is developed for specific tasks, aimed at solving specific problems for specific users or organizations. The requirements of the user or organization are perfectly matched, and these software can be easily changed since they are developed by local programmers. Examples include payroll systems, inventory management, school management, billing software, and mark sheet evaluation systems.</p>

    <h1>Operating System - Introduction</h1>
    
    <p>An operating system (OS) is an integrated set of programs that controls overall resources such as the CPU, memory, and input-output devices of a computer system. The major objective of an operating system is to improve the performance and efficiency of a computer system. Like the manager of a company, an operating system is responsible for the smooth and efficient functioning of the entire computer system.</p>

    <p>The operating system provides a platform for other application programs/software to run and execute. It provides users with an interface so that they can easily communicate with the computer, making it more convenient to use and operate.</p>

    <p>An operating system is a collection of programs that controls the overall operation of the computer system. It also controls and coordinates the use of hardware among various application programs for different users. It acts as an interface between the user and the computer hardware. The other major functions of an operating system are:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>It controls, monitors, and coordinates the overall operation of the computer system.</li>
        <li>It acts as an interface between the user and the computer.</li>
        <li>It provides a platform to develop, run, and execute other computer programs.</li>
        <li>It manages hardware resources such as the CPU, memory, input-output terminals, networking equipment, etc.</li>
        <li>It hides programming and hardware complexity from the user.</li>
    </ul>
<h1>Types of Operating System (OS)</h1>
    
    <h2>A) On the basis of processing</h2>

    <h3>1) Multi-programming OS</h3>
    <p>Multi-programming is used in a multi-user environment. It is a technique in which multiple user programs are executed simultaneously by a single processor. Multi-programming means when two or more programs are provided to the CPU for processing or loaded in the internal storage of the CPU at the same time. Once the portion of one program is executed, the portion of another program is executed, and so on. Thus, multi-programming refers to the concurrent execution of several programs. The main purpose of multi-programming is to increase the utilization of computer and its resources. Different forms of multi-programming OS are multi-tasking, multi-processing, and multi-user.</p>

    <h3>2) Multi-tasking OS</h3>
    <p>Multi-tasking OS allows more than one program to run concurrently, mainly in a single user system. These computers are capable of executing several tasks or programs at the same time. For executing several tasks, it can be a single or multi-processing system. In some multi-tasking systems, one of the processes is called foreground (active), while others are called background (inactive). Multi-tasking OS increases the productivity of the user by executing many tasks simultaneously. Examples include MS-Windows, Linux, MAC OS, etc.</p>

    <h3>3) Multiprocessing OS</h3>
    <p>Multi-processing systems have more than one processor linked in a coordinated way. Multiprocessing OS supports running a program on more than one CPU. Generally, super servers are especially designed to support multiple processors. UNIX is commonly used as a multi-processing OS. Multi-programming and multi-processing are not the same concept. Multi-programming involves the concurrent execution of two or more programs by a single CPU, whereas multi-processing involves two or more processors (CPUs) controlling the different activities or executing many programs simultaneously. This concept is also known as parallel processing. It is a more costly and complex technique than multi-programming, dramatically increasing the program execution speed of the computer.</p>

    <h3>4) Time-Sharing OS</h3>
    <p>Time-sharing is a technique that enables many people located in various terminals to use a particular computer system at the same time. Processor time, shared among multiple users simultaneously, is termed as time-sharing. Multiple jobs are executed by the CPU by switching between them, but the switches occur so frequently that users can receive an immediate response.</p>
    <h4>Advantages:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Provides quick response.</li>
        <li>Reduces CPU idle time.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Disadvantages:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Problem of reliability.</li>
        <li>Less security.</li>
        <li>Integrity issues.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>5) Batch Processing OS</h3>
    <p>Batch processing is a technique in which similar jobs are grouped together, consisting of programs, data, and system commands. This type of processing is suitable for programs that involve large completion or calculations, like payroll, weather forecasting, or statistical analysis. Users need not wait while the job is being processed. They can submit their program to the operator and collect it later. Jobs are stored on a disk in a batch or queue and executed one after another under the control of the OS.</p>
    <p>The major disadvantage of batch processing is that it does not allow interaction between the user and the program during execution.</p>

    <h3>6) Multi-threading OS</h3>
    <p>A program in execution is known as a process and can be divided into multiple smaller sub-processes. These sub-processes are known as threads. Multi-threading OS has the ability to divide processes into threads and execute them concurrently. Threads are individual processes that execute simultaneously in multi-tasking OS.</p>

    <h3>7) Real-time OS</h3>
    <p>Real-time processing is one that controls the environment by receiving data and taking action quickly to affect the functioning of the environment at the same instant. It is an online processing system where processing time is critical. The entire processing task has to be completed in a predefined time. Real-time OS is suitable for operations such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Airlines or flight seat availability</li>
        <li>Rocket launching systems</li>
        <li>Wholesale supplier and manufacturer systems</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>8) Online Processing OS</h3>
    <p>Online processing is a popular processing technique in which transactions are processed as soon as they happen at the place of origin. It is simpler compared to real-time OS. In this method, users can interact or provide input during processing. The output is provided back to the user as soon as the processing is completed.</p>

    <h2>B) On the basis of User Interface (UI)</h2>
    <p>A user interface allows users to interact with the computer system. It provides an ideal environment to enhance user experience and interaction with the computer. There are two main types of user interfaces:</p>
<table>
<tr>
<td>
    <h3>1) Character User Interface (CUI)</h3>
    <p>CUI is a type of operating system in which the computer operates based on commands issued by the user. All operations require specific commands, making it non-user-friendly. Only individuals with technical knowledge can operate such systems. It is a primitive type of OS where graphics, pictures, icons, drop-down menus, and dialogue boxes are not used, making it harder to use. CUI uses the text mode of a computer, such as MS-DOS and UNIX. A command prompt is a sequence of characters used in CUI. Commands are typed in to instruct the computer.</p>
    
    <h4>Features of CUI:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Single-user, single-tasking operating system.</li>
        <li>Less user-friendly compared to GUI.</li>
        <li>Commands are used to instruct the computer.</li>
        <li>Requires the user to remember commands.</li>
        <li>Cannot display graphics or multimedia.</li>
        <li>Faster than GUI systems.</li>
        <li>Does not recognize pointing devices like mouse or joystick.</li>
        <li>Can be used in low memory and low processing power computers.</li>
    </ul>
</td>
<td>
    <h3>2) Graphical User Interface (GUI)</h3>
    <p>GUI is an operating system in which computers are operated by clicking or selecting icons or dialogue boxes instead of typing direct commands. Graphics such as icons, pictures, drop-down menus, and dialogue boxes make it more user-friendly than CUI. Since the user does not need to remember commands, it is easy to use for non-technical people. The main goal of a GUI is to create an environment where the user can operate the computer without training or remembering commands. Examples of GUI operating systems include Windows, MAC OS, etc.</p>

    <h4>Features of GUI:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>User-friendly interface.</li>
        <li>No need to remember commands.</li>
        <li>Supports full multimedia and animation.</li>
        <li>Requires larger memory for processing.</li>

    <h3>1) Single User</h3>
    <p>A single user OS is designed for use by a single user at any given time. It is most commonly used on home computers or office systems. There are two general types of single-user systems: single-user single-tasking and single-user multi-tasking. Examples of single-user single-tasking OS include MS-DOS and PC-DOS.</p>

    <h3>2) Multi-User</h3>
    <p>Multi-user OS allows multiple users at different terminals to access a single system with one OS. The multi-user OS shares computer resources among users, allowing each user a slice of the processor's time. This is also known as time-sharing. It gives users the impression that they are being served simultaneously, even though the OS serves them one at a time. Examples of multi-user OS include Linux and UNIX.</p>

    <h1>Chapter 5: Programming </h1>
    <p>As we know, every computerized device does not work by itself. They need to be given some sort of command that makes the computer work. These commands help to instruct the computer and program specific actions required by the user. Since the commands are given in the form of a computer language, programming languages are used to write the set of instructions which command the computer to perform certain actions collectively, called programs. These programs are then integrated to make a complete software. Simply put, software is the collection of different interrelated programs that perform specific functions.</p>

    <p>The program written in any type of programming language is not understood by the computer; hence, we need some sort of language translator or processor such as an assembler, compiler, and interpreter. Their basic function is to convert programs written in any language into machine-level language.</p>

    <p>The program written by the programmer is known as the source program. After converting it, it becomes the object program.</p>

    <h2>Qualities of Good Programs</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>It should be easily understood.</li>
        <li>A program should be correct; it should be error-free.</li>
        <li>It should be reliable.</li>
        <li>It should have an easily understandable user interface.</li>
        <li>It should be portable and flexible.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Programming Language</h2>
    <p>In order to make communication between the user and computer, we need a computer language that helps the user to generate commands to perform as per the requirement. This language, with which we can give instructions to the computer, is known as a programming language. Programming languages are the set of different keywords, variables, operators, loops, and other entities using different character sets including numbers, special symbols, and alphanumeric values.</p>

    <p>Hence, the process of writing the programming language is known as programming, and the person who writes programs is called a programmer.</p>

    <h2>Types of Programming Language</h2>
    <h3>1. Low-Level Language</h3>
    <p>Low-level languages are machine-dependent languages. This means the program written for one type of system cannot be run on another system. Developers must have detailed knowledge about the system they are writing a program for. Programming in low-level languages is difficult and time-consuming.</p>
<table>
<tr>
<td>
    <h4>a. Machine Level Language (1GL)</h4>
    <p>This language consists of a sequence of 0’s and 1’s to generate instructions. Since it uses binary numbers, this type of language is directly understood by the processor, resulting in higher execution speeds. However, it is machine-dependent.</p>

    <h5>Advantages:</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>Directly understood by the processor, leading to high execution speed.</li>
        <li>Language translator is not needed.</li>
        <li>Can be used to program specific-purpose computers.</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>Disadvantages:</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>Hard to develop and debug programs.</li>
        <li>Machine dependent; cannot be transferred across different systems.</li>
        <li>Commands are in binary, which is difficult to remember.</li>
        <li>Programmers must have detailed knowledge of the system.</li>
    </ul>
</td>
<td>
    <h4>b. Assembly Language (2GL)</h4>
    <p>Assembly language is also a low-level language. Instead of writing instructions in a series of 0’s and 1’s, we can use mnemonics like ADD, SUB, RST, etc. This language is closer to machine-level language but still requires a language translator like an assembler.</p>

    <h5>Advantages:</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>Easier to write, debug, and understand compared to machine-level language.</li>
        <li>Faster execution compared to high-level languages.</li>
        <li>Used to develop device drivers.</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>Disadvantages:</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>Machine dependent; programs written for one processor do not work on another.</li>
        <li>More complex to use due to mnemonics.</li>
        <li>Development and debugging are more difficult compared to high-level languages.</li>
    </ul>
</td>
<td>
    <h4>2. High-Level Language</h4>
    <p>High-level languages are closer to the English language, which makes it easier to develop and debug programs. These languages are machine-independent, meaning programs written for one system can work on others.</p>

    <h5>Advantages:</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>Programs are easier to write, debug, and understand.</li>
        <li>Machine-independent; programs can run on different systems.</li>
        <li>No need to remember complex mnemonics.</li>
        <li>Faster program development.</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>Disadvantages:</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>Requires translation into machine-level language before execution.</li>
        <li>Slower execution compared to low-level languages.</li>

<tr>
<Td>
    <h5>a. Procedural-Oriented Language (3GL)</h5>
    <p>This type of language focuses on procedures or routines. It is used to express logic and procedure. It follows a top-down approach, where the main function is written at the bottom of the program.</p>

    <h5>Advantages:</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>Easier to write and debug programs compared to low-level languages.</li>
        <li>Used for general-purpose programming.</li>
        <li>Machine-independent.</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>Disadvantages:</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>Requires a language translator to execute the program.</li>
        <li>Program execution is slower compared to low-level languages.</li>
    </ul>
</td>
<td>
    <h5>b. Problem/Objective-Oriented Language (4GL)</h5>
    <p>This is an advanced form of high-level language that focuses more on data than on procedure. It uses a bottom-up approach.</p>

    <h5>Advantages:</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>Supports advanced, user-friendly software development.</li>
        <li>Machine-independent.</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>Disadvantages:</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>Requires a language translator.</li>
        <li>Execution is slower.</li>
    </ul>
</td>
<td>
    <h5>c. Natural Language (5GL)</h5>
    <p>Natural language uses common language to express commands. It's still in the development stage, with languages like PROLOG being used.</p>

    <h5>Advantages:</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>Easy to write and debug programs.</li>
        <li>Machine-independent.</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>Disadvantages:</h5>

    <h1>Chapter 7: Introduction to Multimedia</h1>

    <p>Multimedia consists of two words: ‘Multi’ and ‘Media’. Where ‘multi’ means many and ‘media’ means way/medium of expressing information. Hence, multimedia is the way of expressing information in different forms. The information can be expressed in either text, audio, video, graphics, and animation. We use several forms of media for better understanding and effective communication. By using multimedia, any information can be illustrated in greater depth.</p>

    <p>Since a single form of media is inefficient for better communication and greater understanding, we integrate several components of multimedia (text, audio, video, animation, and graphics) by using multimedia computer systems. Hence, the integration of different forms of media is mandatory for effective communication. A multimedia computer system consists of multimedia hardware and multimedia software. Printer, projector, webcam, microphone, digital camera, etc., are some of the widely used multimedia computer hardware. Similarly, software like text editors (MS Word), presentation tools (PowerPoint), photo editing (Photoshop), video editing (iMovie), accounting packages (Tally), etc., are used as multimedia software. These multimedia hardware and software work together in order to integrate several components of multimedia. For example, a video can be created by integrating audio and images.</p>

    <h2>Components/Elements of Multimedia</h2>
<table>
<tr>
<td>
    <h3>Text</h3>
    It is the collection of alpha numeric values or any characters. It can be a word, single line or a paragraph. We can create and customize text by using several text editor or word processor such as MS-Word, Notepad etc. It is the basic form or way of expressing information. By using multimedia software we can customize the text by giving several size, color, type, style etc. Extension of text documents are .docx, .txt etc.
</td>
<td>
    <h3>Graphics/Images</h3>
    ”A picture is of thousand words" which means picture can describe things more than a text. Graphics generally refers to image or pictures. The smallest element of picture is called Pixel (Picture Element). Hence the quality of image or picture is denoted by number of pixel available in that picture, Generally termed as resolution. We use several multimedia software such as Adobe Photo shop, Corel draw, Adobe indesign etc. Extension of images are .jpeg, .png etc.
</td>
<Td>
    <h3>Audio</h3>
    Audio is the one of the important components of multimedia. It gives the sensation of hearing. Audio can be used to enhance the understanding level in any particular topic. Audio can be human voice, instrument notes, natural sound, digitally synthesized sound and many more. In these days Audio can be transfer from one place to another by converting it into digital signal. FM radio use this component to express their information. Several multimedia software such as windows media player can be used to play audio. Extension of audio are .mp3, .wma etc.
</td>
<td>
    <h3>Video</h3>
   The video is the running frames of static pictures that means video are generated by capturing maximum number of images in unit time. Frame per second [FPS] is the term widely used to describe the smoothness of a video. Generally there are 15-25 frame per seconds, to generate smooth movement in video. But 30 and 60 FPS are the widely used standard in different devices. We can use different multimedia software such as iMovie, Final cut pro, Filmora etc to edit and customize our video. Extension of video are .mp4, .mpeg etc.
</td>
<Td>
    <h3>Animation</h3>
    Animation is the sequence of vector(Computer Generated) image displayed in rapid succession to provide visual effects. These image are computer based images. The animation is created to express ideas where complex explanation should be effectively deliver. These components are widely used in movie industry, and in other entertainment industry. Animation can be either 2D or 3D. 3D animation are more realistic in nature. So, different movies used 3D animation to express information which are not feasible in real life. We use several multimedia software such as Maya animation, Auto CAD, Macromedia flash etc. Extension of animation are .flv, .gif etc.

    <h1>Chapter 8: Information Security and Cyber Laws </h1>
    <p>As we know, In a network or cyber space there is always threat of cyber attacks which may leads to loss and damages of our precious data and information. It is always necessary to be aware of such malicious activity. We need to adopt different measures while using computer from such intentional and accidental activities. Thus, information security refers to the process of protecting our network infrastructure from unauthorized access, misuse, modification, destruction or any malfunction. We can use several physical and software preventive measures to protect ourselves from such unethical activities. Information security helps to create a secure environment for computers, users and programs.</p>
    
    <p>Information security can mitigate security threats and security attacks. Security threats is possible danger that might cause unwanted activities in our computer system to breach security and thus cause possible harm whereas security attack is an attempt to gain unauthorized access to destroy, expose, steal or alter others valuable data and information. This attacks can be triggered by malicious application such as viruses, spyware, Trojan horse, WORMS etc.</p>

    <p>Information security are built around three major objectives:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Confidentiality:</strong> It means information are available for only the authorized individual, that means individual or any other system cannot use or process others information without proper authorization.</li>
        <li><strong>Integrity:</strong> It indicates accuracy and completeness of data and information which means without proper authorization data and information cannot be tampered.</li>
        <li><strong>Availability:</strong> It means information must be always available as per the requirement of the user. It generally refers to accessing out valuable data and information whenever required with in no time.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Cryptography</h2>
    <p>The cryptography is derived from the Greek word which means “Secret writing”. Cryptography is the art and science of hiding information. It provides security for information. It is used for providing secure communication between individuals, government agencies and military force. Cryptography mostly refers to Encryption and Decryption. Encryption is the process of converting plaintext that is message to unreadable format. So that anyone who tries to see the message cannot read the original message. The plain text are converted into unreadable text using special algorithm and keys. The unreadable text is called cipher text. These cipher text are again converted into readable form through the process of decryption. Decryption is the reverse process of encryption. Sometimes, encryption is also termed as encoding or encipher and its reverse process i.e. decryption is also termed as decoding or decipher.</p>

    <h2>2. What is Digital Divide?</h2>
    <p>Digital Divide is the term used for the gap between the computer literate and illiterate people. Or it can be said that it is a division between technical and non-technical man powers in the field. IT is the modern technology and for the use of this technology, one can have sound knowledge of computers. But still there are a great number of people, who do not know the computers’ operations. They do not understand the computer related terms. This difference or gap is called digital divide. First, this term came into practice in the mid of 1990s by political speeches and news media. This division is increasing day by day in between urban area people and rural area people, educated and uneducated, rich and poor and so on. So it has become a global issue and governments are trying to bridge this gap.</p>

    <h2>3. What are the computer ethics or cyber ethics?</h2>
    <p>The computer ethics or the cyber ethics are the set of moral principles or the codes of conduct, which should be strictly followed by the computer professionals. The intention of the computer or cyber ethics is to avoid the criminal activities through the use of computers. The following are some examples of computer ethics:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Do not use other’s password</li>
        <li>Do not steal other’s information</li>
        <li>Do not use computers to harm others</li>
        <li>Do not disclose other’s secrecy</li>
        <li>Do not spread virus in the network</li>
        <li>Do not copy licensed software, which you have not paid</li>
        <li>Do not alter other’s data</li>
        <li>Do not take possession to other people’s intellectual property</li>
        <li>Do not misuse electronic transaction</li>
        <li>Do not use computer to bear false witness</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. What is cyber crime? List out some examples of cyber crimes.</h2>
    <p>The act of misusing computers, Internet or other electronic media is called cyber crime. As the use of Information Technology is increasing, the act of cyber crime is also increasing day by day. The following are some examples of cyber crime:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Misuse of computers</li>
        <li>Spreading virus</li>
        <li>Stealing other’s information</li>
        <li>Pirating licensed software</li>
        <li>Disclosing of other’s secrecy</li>
        <li>Misuse of electronic transaction and electronic media</li>
        <li>Rude and vulgar comments in Internet on racial, communal and others</li>
        <li>Alteration of other data without permission</li>
        <li>Spying others’ information</li>
        <li>Cracking or hacking</li>
        <li>Password guessing</li>
        <li>Salami saving and data diddling</li>
        <li>Forgery</li>
        <li>DOS attack</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. What is Cyber Law? Define and write some provisions of it.</h2>
    <p>The law regarding the use of computers is called Cyber Law. It highly concerns with the misuse of the computers, Internet and other electronic media, which are specially used for information flow. Cyber ethics just suggest not committing computer crimes or cyber crimes but the cyber law strictly defines the punishment in case of violation of the laws or cyber principles. Actually the cyber law is in practice to support the cyber ethics. Nepal Government also has issued the Cyber Law on 11th Falgun, 2061 (18th March 2005) as “The Electronic Transaction Ordinance, 2005”.</p>

    <p>It has the following provisions:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Electronic and Digital Signature Law</li>
        <li>Intellectual Property Law</li>
        <li>Copyright Law</li>
        <li>Trademark Law</li>
        <li>Semiconductor Law</li>
        <li>Patent Law</li>
        <li>Telecommunication Law</li>
        <li>Data Protection and Privacy Law</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Explain the different objectives of IT Policy of Nepal.</h2>
    <p>The IT policies of Nepal are:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>To declare IT as a high priority sector of government and make it practical</li>
        <li>To establish knowledge based industries to increase employment</li>
        <li>To make public information and service delivery inclusive and effective through the philosophy of e-government</li>
